            <li>3 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pound raw shrimp</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Season the sausage pieces with half of the Cajun seasoning.</li>
            <li>Brown sausage in the hot oil; remove with slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
            <li>Saute the onion, bell pepper and celery until onion is soft and transparent. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant (30 seconds).</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomatoes; season with salt, pepper, thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes (or Cayenne powder), hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and the 
                remaining Cajun seasoning. Stir in sausage. Cook for 5 minutes, while stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Add in the rice and chicken broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low-medium. Cover and let simmer for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed 
                and rice is cooked while stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Place the shrimp on top of the Jambalaya mixture, stir through gently and cover with lid. Allow to simmer while stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are 
                cooked through and pink (about 5-6 minutes, depending on the size/thickness of the shrimp being used).
            </li>
            <li>Season with a little extra salt and pepper if needed and remove from heat. Adjust heat with extra hot sauce, Cayenne pepper or Cajun seasoning. Serve immediately.</li>
