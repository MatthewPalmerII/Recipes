            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>1 15oz. can black beans</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen corn kernels</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2oz. queso fresco</li>
            <li>1 handful fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>

    </p></div>
    <div class="sub-heading"><h3>Steps</h3></div>
    <div class="steps-text"><p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel. Place the chicken on a cutting board and cover it with a piece of plastic wrap.
                Use a mallet or rolling pin to gently pound the chicken to an even thickness. This step is very important to make sure the chicken cooks quickly and evenly, without drying out.
            </li>
            <li>Combine the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle the spiced over both sides of the chicken, and then rub it over the 
                surface to make sure it's evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a large deep skilled over medium heat. Add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. Once the skillet is very hot, add the chicken and cook on both
                sides until browned and cooked through (about 5 minutes each side).
            </li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, rinse and drain the black beans. Roughly chop the cilantro.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean cutting board and let it rest while you prepare the creamy salsa. Turn the burner down to medium low. 
                Pour the salsa into the skillet and stire to dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add the black beans and frozen corn kernels and allow
             the sauce to heat through.</li>
            <li>To prevent the sour cream from curdling when added to the salsa, first add a few spoonfuls, one at a time, to the sour cream to slowly increase it's 
                temperature and acidity. Once the sourt cream is slightly warm, add it back to the rest of the salsa in the skillet and stire to combine. Turn the heat off.
            </li>
            <li>Slice the chicken breast into strips, then place it on top of the creamy salsa sauce in the skillet. Top the skillet with crumbled cheese and cilantro. 
                Serve over a bed of cooked rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
